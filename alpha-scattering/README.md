## Alpha particle scattering by gold foil
A alpha source of energy 4 MeV shot along the z direction from (0,0,-1*mm) hits  gold target of size 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 um. A sphere of inner radius 0.999 cm and outer radius 1 cm surrounds it, working as a detector.

The default world material is Air.

### Activities

Read the original work of Geiger and Marsden here:

1. Find out from the first paper, which source he used in the experiment. 

2. Are alpha-rays mono-energetic? What is their typical energy range?

3. What type of detector was used and how far was it placed from the source?

4. What were the other materials used in this experiment?

5. What is the typical thickness of the foils used? 

6. Approximately what was the activity of the source?

7. Approximately, how many alphas were reflected back?


8. Observe how many particles exit the target as a function of target thickness


9. Observe particles come out of the scattering:  
The PDG particle codes are here: https://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/reviews/montecarlorpp.pdf

  - alpha: 1000020000
  - electron: 11

10. What is the proportion of these particles?

11. What is energy of alpha particles?

12. What is energy of electrons?

13. Plot the angular distribution of the alpha particles.  
    - Roughly, what is the percentage of alpha particles that are reflected back.

14. Change the world material to Air and observe what happens to the trajectories. Qualitatively express your observations.  
    - Repeat the entire exercise with Air.
