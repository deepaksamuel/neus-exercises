## Demonstration of muon lifetime with cosmic muon spectra
In this experiment, a 1 cm X 1 cm x 2 cm thick Al plate serves as an absorber and two thin detectors are placed above and below called DetectorB and DetectorM.

We will use the mac file to show the use of GPS.

In the mac file vis.mac, there are two options
- Monoenergetic beam
- Cosmic muon spectrum

This activity should typically after the muon at rest lifetime measurement.
